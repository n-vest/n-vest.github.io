Importantly, children's ability to recognize shape patterns (e.g., square, circle, circle, square, circle, circle) is related to their numerical knowledge. Part of my research focuses on teaching patterns to young children.</p>
<p>In one study, I investigated whether an instructor's gestures could help children identify pattern units and improve their performance in patterning tasks. Additionally, I examined whether having children mimic those gestures helped. The inclusion of gestures by the experimenter (speech plus gesture) did not significantly affect children's learning outcomes compared to using speech alone. Children who were explicitly instructed to mimic the experimenter's behavior (whether speech or speech plus gesture) performed worse on the posttest than those who were not given mimicry instructions. This indicates that instructed mimicry might hinder learning rather than help it. However, children's <i>spontaneous</i> mimicry of the experimenter’s speech (but not gestures) was positively associated with better posttest performance. This suggests that when children choose to mimic speech on their own, it can enhance their learning.</p>
<p>In another study, I examined whether providing perceptual support, such as drawing a line under the pattern unit, would help children recognize the pattern units more effectively. I am currently preparing a manuscript with these results.</p>
<p>In future research, I hope to investigate whether college students can identify patterns in small datasets, specifically focusing on detecting positive and negative linear slopes.</p>
