<p>In a new research project, I plan to investigate the impact of negative numbers on people’s ability to recognize patterns and generalize functions from small data sets. This project emphasizes the role of inductive reasoning, which involves identifying broader patterns from specific examples, in improving comprehension of negative integers. This study highlights the challenges adults face with negative numbers and how these difficulties can impede further mathematical learning.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>To address these challenges, I will design a lesson using worked examples—step-by-step problem-solving guides—to improve people’s function-finding. I will also examine whether incorporating graphs into these examples further improves understanding. My research will aim to answer three key questions: What is the effect of negative numbers on pattern recognition? What is the effectiveness of worked examples in improving accuracy? And what are the additional benefits of including graphs in these examples?</p>
