summary: How do students' explicit and implicit concepts of zero develop, and how do activities with number lines influence their understanding of zero and their ability to use the additive inverse principle?

<p>In my graduate studies, I have investigated students' explicit and implicit concepts of zero, the potential of number line activities to foster sophisticated understandings of zero, and whether these concepts predict students' performance on problems involving the additive inverse principle (X + -X = 0). We assessed explicit concepts through questions about students' definitions of zero (e.g., “What is zero?”) and measure implicit concepts via timed magnitude comparisons (e.g., “Choose the greater number: -2 or 0”).</p>
<p>In one study, at the outset, many children viewed zero as "nothing" (null conception), while some saw it as the symmetry point between positive and negative integers. Children in higher grades were more likely to express a symmetry conception. We hypothesized that conceptions of zero would relate to integer knowledge. Indeed, those with a symmetry conception showed greater understanding of the additive inverse principle and better integer arithmetic skills than those with a null conception. However, conceptions of zero were unrelated to integer magnitude understanding. We also explored whether a brief lesson on zero as the symmetry point could shift conceptions and enhance additive inverse understanding. Participants were randomly assigned to lessons on zero as either null or symmetry, but the brief lesson did not significantly change their conceptions or additive inverse knowledge.</p>
<p>In future research, I will develop and employ more extensive assessments of children’s concepts of zero and their understanding of the additive inverse principle. I will also test more substantial interventions, as longer and more intense sessions have shown significant effects in similar contexts.</p>
