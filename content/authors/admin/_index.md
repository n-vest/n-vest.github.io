<i>Hello! üëã </i>

I am a graduate student in the [Department of Psychology](https://psych.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and I am a member of the [Cognitive Development and Communication Lab](https://alibali.psych.wisc.edu/). 

Prior to graduate school, I was a lab manager for the [Learning, Education, and Development Lab](https://leadlab.sitehost.iu.edu/) in the [Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences](https://psych.indiana.edu/index.html) at Indiana University.

<strong>Broadly, my research interests include numerical and mathematical cognitive development.</strong> I am particularly passionate about exploring how cognitive processes intersect with education and child development, and I aim to make meaningful contributions to these fields through my research.
