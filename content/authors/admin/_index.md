<i>Hello! üëã </i>

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [School of Teaching and Learning](https://education.ufl.edu/school-teaching-learning/) at the University of Florida.

<strong>My research examines the cognitive processes that shape numerical understanding - especially how learners build on what they already know to accommodate new mathematical concepts.</strong> I focus on how these skills develop in children and how they relate to educational experiences, with the goal of advancing our understanding of learning and thinking.

I earned my Ph.D. in [Department of Psychology](https://psych.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where I was a member of the [Cognitive Development and Communication Lab](https://alibali.psych.wisc.edu/).
